# Why not this way of world saving? A Novel Approach to Hydrogen Production Using Multistage Catalytic Cycles

## üåç Motivation

Hydrogen is essential for maintaining an industrialized society while mitigating climate change. Current large-scale hydrogen production attempts rely on electricity and require vast areas of land‚Äîup to 300 square kilometers per facility. Moreover, scaling this to meet the needs of agriculture, aviation, shipping, and steel industries would demand thousands of such facilities.

These methods, based on electrolysis and renewable electricity, face several challenges:

- High energy losses  
- Significant carbon footprint during ramp-up  
- Rapid electrode degradation due to the high binding energy of hydrogen  
- Underutilization of direct heat sources like geothermal or solar furnaces  

## üéØ Project Goal

This project explores an alternative method: using **multistage catalytic reactions** to split water into hydrogen without relying solely on electricity. The goal is to investigate:

- Why conventional catalysts are not typically used for molecular hydrogen production  
- Whether breaking down water-splitting into incremental chemical steps is feasible  

### Key Hypothesis

**reduce the hydrogen binding energy** step by step    

The *(very likely unreachable)* goal is to identify catalytic reaction chains that form a closed loop, consuming water and heat while producing molecular hydrogen. The recent approach identifies different molecules with their hydrogen bounding energies. These molecules are seen as possible intermediate
molecules in the reaction chain. Further some catalytic reaction from a molecule given bounding energy to molecule of a lower bounding energy is searched.
The bounding energy should go to low, because the molecule should be stable at normal conditions.

## ü§ñ Leveraging Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) already demonstrate capabilities in chemical reasoning. The LLM is used a knowledge base for the field of chemistry. It is used
as tool to handle a large amount of knowledge required to create a large chemical reaction chain.

In future stages, specialized AI tools like [ChemCrow](https://github.com/ur-whitelab/chemcrow-public) may be integrated for more precise modeling.

## üí° Expectations

This project is not intended to replace industrial hydrogen production. Instead, it aims to:

- Serve as a **proof of concept** for identifying novel catalytic cycles  
- Provide a **framework or tool** for exploring chemical reaction paths using AI  
- Demonstrate the **potential of LLMs** in supporting chemical innovation
